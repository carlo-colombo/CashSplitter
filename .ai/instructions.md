When developing new production code we are following TDD practise to 
* write a test
* see it failing
* update the code to fix the test
* refactoring

Do not skip any step, and check with the user if you can proceed

When creating support scripts for development, TDD is not necessary

Read the README.md file present in the root of the project to understand what we are building, when adding a new feature or a development step update it.

When implementing tasks from the TODO only implement one at the time. Add new tasks as needed to the TODO.

Be concise, include a summary of the changes but avoid explanations of them
